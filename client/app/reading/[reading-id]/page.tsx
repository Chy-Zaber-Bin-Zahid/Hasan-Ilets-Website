                        In 2016, the British professional tennis player Andy Murray was ranked as the world&apos;s number
                        one. It was an incredible achievement by any standard â€“ made even more remarkable by the
                        fact that he did this during a period considered to be one of the strongest in the sport&apos;s
                        history, competing against the likes of Rafael Nadal, Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic, to
                        name just a few. Yet five years previously, he had been regarded as a talented outsider who
                        entered but never won the major tournaments.
